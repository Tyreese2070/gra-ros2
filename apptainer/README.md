## ROS Jazzy Apptainer Setup
Follow each bullet point in steps below.
>1. Open a terminal in uni cluster

Clone `gra-ros2` into dev branch
```bash
mkdir -p ~/colcon_ws/src
git clone -b dev https://github.com/GryphonRacingAI/gra-ros2.git ~/colcon_ws/src
cd ~/colcon_ws/src/apptainer
```
>2. Building apptainer container with dependencies and ros2 jazzy environment.
- Paste the contents of `setup_apptainer.sh` into the terminal.

This automaticallys builds the container images and places in `/local/data/$USER` in 15 minutes

>3. Enter your apptainer
```bash
cd /local/data/$USER
apptainer shell --nv /local/data/$USER/ros_jazzy.sif
```
When you see the REPL below you are inside your container.

```Apptainer>```
>4. Sourcing environment
- `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash`

You can create a file in `~` like `.fsairc` with any source or config scripts.
- `echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash" > ~/.fsairc`

`source ~/.fsairc` would make sourcing inside your apptainer easier.

You can now try running `ros2 launch simulation `
>5. Creating an alias to enter apptainer efficiently

Make sure you are not inside apptainer
- `echo "alias fsai='apptainer shell --nv /local/data/\$USER/ros_jazzy.sif'" >> ~/.bashrc`

Now running: `fsai` should allow you to enter your apptainer container 
## Creating your Custom Apptainer Container with extra dependencies
- `cd /local/data/$USER`

That `ros_jazzy.sif` script takes around 10 minutes to complete, to add your own dependencies without waiting for 15 minutes or breaking things accidentally the `custom.def` file exists.

Familiarize yourself with containers if you haven't used containers before, if you have 
[apptainer docs](https://apptainer.org/documentation/) is self-explanatory.

>Add your custom dependencies or files in `/local/data/$USER`
- add any local files you can't extract from web eg things like installer (e.g. `ros_jazzy.def` used ZED_SDK installer, cuda key ring, .deb files etc.
- creating your own bash script e.g: `setup_username_custom.sh` is a good idea to keep track of files you added for your `custom.def`
- make sure to add to the `%files%` 
- usually done by `apt-get -y <ros-pkg-name>` in the `%runscript%` section of `custom.def`

>Build your custom container with: 
- `apptainer build custom.sif custom.def`
>Enter your custom container wtih:
- `apptainer shell --nv custom.sif`
## Accessing University Apptainer containers remotely using SSH with GUI
Over weekends or out of uni hours you can access your containers using the method below.
>Get uol vpn

- Go to `feng-linux.leeds.ac.uk` on your browser
- `ssh -Y <username>@uol-pc-<id>` make sure to note the `<id>` of local pc where you installed your containers

**Note:** If above doesn't work pc must be remotely powered on by following the steps below:
- `module add wol`
- `wol -h <ip> <mac>`

Email the Technical Director: `sc23pg@leeds.ac.uk` for the `ip`, `mac`, and `id` values of 

If too many people use the same local pc things may be slow so `sc23pg` may have to request for more: `ip`, `mac` values for a pc with `id` in Bragg Cluster.

Turning on the computer may take a few minutes, then you can `ssh` into it.

## Troubleshooting
**Disk Quota Limit Exceeded**:

You shouldn't get this if you have used `/local/data/$USER` if you do let Technical Director know.
- run `quota` to check your disk quota
- run `du -sh * | sort -h` at `~` to see where disk space is being used
- carefully use `rm` to free up space, be sure to backup or important files (eg git commits)

Note: the `ros_jazzy.sif` file should only take up: 12 GB of space.
- Read more about [Disk Quotas](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-disk-quotas) or contact admin if you still run into issues or need more space.

- This is why we are using the shared disk space in `/local/data` not the NFS shared across university networks, which has ~15 GB quota per student.
